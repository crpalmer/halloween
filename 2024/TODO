-------------

- new led ring is 72mm outer diamer and 54mm inner diameter
- does the main led ring want to elevated a little bit so it
  is less bulb-like?
- improve the logic of the rotation timing?  right now I feel like
  the rounding to the ms is really arbitrary and I don't understand
  what it's doing

general:
--------

- audio-config: make a concrete version of the object that lets you
  do "new AudioConfig(AudioConfig *c)" and/or audio_config.copy(audio_config)
  and use that all over instead of having other object keep their own local
  variables and update them?
